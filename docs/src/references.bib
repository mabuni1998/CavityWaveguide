@article{Heuck2020,
   abstract = {We show that relatively simple integrated photonic circuits have the potential to realize a high fidelity deterministic controlled-phase gate between photonic qubits using bulk optical nonlinearities. The gate is enabled by converting travelling continuous-mode photons into stationary cavity modes using strong classical control fields that dynamically change the effective cavity-waveguide coupling rate. This architecture succeeds because it reduces the wave packet distortions that otherwise accompany the action of optical nonlinearities [J. Shapiro, Phys. Rev. A 73, 062305 (2006)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.73.062305; J. Gea-Banacloche, Phys. Rev. A 81, 043823 (2010)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.81.043823]. We show that high-fidelity gates can be achieved with self-phase modulation in χ(3) materials as well as second-harmonic generation in χ(2) materials. The gate fidelity asymptotically approaches unity with increasing storage time for an incident photon wave packet with fixed duration. We also show that dynamically coupled cavities enable a trade-off between errors due to loss and wave packet distortion. Our proposed architecture represents a new approach to practical implementation of quantum gates that is roomerature compatible and only relies on components that have been individually demonstrated.},

@article{Krastanov2022,
   abstract = {<p>We propose an architecture for achieving high-fidelity deterministic quantum logic gates on dual-rail encoded photonic qubits by letting photons interact with a two-level emitter (TLE) inside an optical cavity. The photon wave packets that define the qubit are preserved after the interaction due to a quantum control process that actively loads and unloads the photons from the cavity and dynamically alters their effective coupling to the TLE. The controls rely on nonlinear wave mixing between cavity modes enhanced by strong externally modulated electromagnetic fields or on AC Stark shifts of the TLE transition energy. We numerically investigate the effect of imperfections in terms of loss and dephasing of the TLE as well as control field miscalibration. Our results suggest that III-V quantum dots in GaAs membranes is a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing.</p>},

Our interest is to understand how a low-dimensional quantum system driven by coherent fields, e.g., a two-level system, a Jaynes-Cummings system, or a photon pair source driven by a laser pulse, emits photons into a waveguide. Of particular relevance to solid-state sources is that we provide a way to include dissipation into the formalism for temporal-mode quantum optics. We will discuss the connections between temporal-mode quantum optics, scattering matrices, quantum stochastic calculus, continuous matrix product states and operators, and very traditional quantum optical concepts such as the Mandel photon counting formula and the Lindblad form of the quantum-optical master equation. We close with an example of how our formalism relates to single-photon sources with dephasing.},

   abstract = {We present two different methods for modeling non-Markovian quantum light-matter interactions in waveguide QED systems, using matrix product states (MPSs) and a space-discretized waveguide (SDW) model. After describing the general theory and implementation of both approaches, we compare and contrast these methods directly on three topical problems of interest in waveguide-QED, including (i) a two-level system (TLS) coupled to an infinite (one-dimensional) waveguide, (ii) a TLS coupled to a terminated waveguide with a time-delayed coherent feedback, and (iii) two spatially separated TLSs coupled within an infinite waveguide. Both approaches are shown to efficiently describe multiphoton nonlinear dynamics in highly non-Markovian regimes, and we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for modeling waveguide QED interactions, including their implementation in python, computational run times, and ease of conceptual understanding. We explore both vacuum dynamics as well as regimes of strong optical pumping, where a weak excitation approximation cannot be applied. The MPS approach scales better when modeling multiphoton dynamics and long delay times and explicitly includes non-Markovian memory effects. In contrast, the SDW model accounts for non-Markovian effects through space discretization and solves Markovian equations of motion, yet rigorously includes the effects of retardation. The SDW model, based on an extension of recent collisional pictures in quantum optics, is solved through quantum trajectory techniques and can more easily add in additional dissipation processes, including off-chip decay and TLS pure dephasing. The impact of these processes is shown directly on feedback-induced population trapping and TLS entanglement between spatially separated TLSs.},

We develop a complete input-output theory to describe the driving of quantum systems by arbitrary incident pulses of radiation and the quantum state of the field emitted into any desired outgoing temporal mode. Our theory is applicable to the transformation and interaction of pulses of radiation by their coupling to a wide class of material quantum systems. We discuss the most essential differences between quantum interactions with pulses and with discrete radiative eigenmodes and present examples relevant to quantum information protocols with optical, microwave, and acoustic waves.},

We assume Markovian coupling of the stationary system to the input and output fields and nondispersive asymptotic propagation of the pulses before and after the interaction. This permits derivation of a master equation where the input and output pulses are treated as single oscillator modes that both couple to the local system in a cascaded manner. As examples of our theory, we analyze reflection by an empty cavity with phase noise, stimulated atomic emission by a quantum light pulse, and formation of a Schrödinger-cat state by the dispersive interaction of a coherent pulse and a single atom in a cavity.},

   abstract = {Sorting quantum fields into different modes according to their Fock-space quantum numbers is a highly desirable quantum operation. In this Letter, we show that a pair of two-level emitters, chirally coupled to a waveguide, may scatter single- and two-photon components of an input pulse into orthogonal temporal modes with a fidelity ≳0.9997. We develop a general theory to characterize and optimize this process and reveal that such a high fidelity is enabled by an interesting two-photon scattering dynamics: while the first emitter gives rise to a complex multimode field, the second emitter recombines the field amplitudes, and the net two-photon scattering induces a self-time reversal of the input pulse mode. The presented scheme can be employed to construct logic elements for propagating photons, such as a deterministic nonlinear-sign gate with a fidelity ≳0.9995.},

The transformed master equation offers important insights into the system dynamics, and it permits numerically efficient solutions.},

They can carry quantum information over extended distances to act as the backbone of a future quantum internet1 and can be manipulated in advanced photonic circuits, enabling scalable photonic quantum computing2,3. However, more sophisticated devices and protocols need access to multi-photon states with particular forms of entanglement. Efficient light–matter interfaces offer a route to reliably generating these entangled resource states4,5. Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide to realize a quantum nonlinear interaction between single-photon wavepackets. We demonstrate the control of a photon using a second photon mediated by the quantum emitter. The dynamical response of the two-photon interaction is experimentally unravelled and reveals quantum correlations controlled by the pulse duration. Further development of this platform work, which constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics6, will enable the tailoring of complex photonic quantum resource states.},
